# League of legends playlist corpus

## What is your corpus, why did you choose it, and what do you think is interesting about it?

My corpus is the League of legends corpus made by spotify.  It is an interesting corpus because it is a wide collection of music from several gernes and cultures which are all grouped under the banner "Gaming music". I think it will be interesting if I can find correlations between the songs to see what makes a song a "gaming song". It is also a really popular playlist so I am rather sure of the validity of my corpus.

## What are the natural groups or comparison points in your corpus (e.g., albums, artists, genres, people)? What do you expect to be different among these groups, what do you expect to be the same, and what are you unsure about? 

The comparison groups are genres, and people. I expect a great difference between the songs in nearly all metrics. However I expect that most songs will be electronic, or have similairity in bass and vocals pitch. I am unsure about the pacing of the songs and more underlying similairties. I am greatly curious what will be the underlying common trait these songs have.

## How representative are the tracks in your corpus for the groups you want to compare?

These tracks are greatly representative, this is due to the massive popularity of the playlist since it has been published by spotify. It is also mostly restricted to 1 game however this game is massively popular globally (its playerbase is biggest in China) thus I think the corupus should have a broad global representation

## Identify several tracks in your corpus that are either extremely typical or atypical. 

Warriors from imagine dragons is very typical, while maniac from carpeterbrut is anything but typical since it is dark synth.
